definition agent,anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators
word percept refer,it refer to the content an agents sensors are perceiving
agents percept sequence,the complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived
general,what does an agents choice of action at any given instant depend on
say mathematically agents behavior,an agents behavior is described by the agent function that maps any given percept sequence to an action
artificial inteligence stucked consequentialism,we evaluate an agents behavior by its consequences
capture desirability related consequentialism artificial inteligence model,it can be captured by a performance measure that evaluates any given sequence of environment states
difference desirability human machine,human measures it from their point of view

difference omniscience rationality,an omniscient agent knows the actual outcome of its actions and can act accordingly but omniscience is impossible in reality
relationship rationality perfection,rationality maximizes expected performance
information gathering means,doing actions in order to modify future percepts
say agent lacks autonomy,an agent relies on the prior knowledge of its designer rather than on its own percepts and learning processes

task environments,they are essentially the problems to which rational agents are the solutions
peas description,specify the performance measure
range task environments might arise artificial inteligence obviously vast,we can identify a fairly small number of dimensions along which task environments can be categorized
dimensions indentify task environments,fully observable vs partially observable singleagent vs multiagent deterministic vs nondeterministic episodic vs sequential static vs dynamic discrete vs continuous known vs unknown
say task environment fully observable,an agents sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time
say task environment deterministic,the next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the action executed by the agents
task environment makes agent need worry uncertainty,fully observable and deterministic
difference stochastic nondeterministic,we say that a model of the environment is stochastic if it explicitly deals with probabilities eg
say task environment episodic,the agents experience is divided into atomic episodes
say task environment sequential,the current decision of agent could affect all future decisions

problem generator components learning agent,it is responsible for suggesting actions that will lead to new and informative experiences

complex decisions invovle,complex decisions involve intricate combination of factual and heuristic knowledge
structure expert system reflect,the structure of expert systems reflect the knowledge engineers understanding of the methods of representing knowledge and of how to perform intelligent decision making tasks with the support of a computer based system
backward chaining,backward chaining starts from the goal and works backward through inference rules to find the required facts that support the goal
research strategy backward chaining reasoning,backward chaining reasoning applies a depthfirst search strategy
backward chaining apply,it is suitable for diagnostic
forward chaining,forward chaining starts from known facts and applies inference rule to extract more data unit it reaches to the goal
research strategy forward chaining reasoning,forward chaining reasoning applies a breadthfirst search strategy
